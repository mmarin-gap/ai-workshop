# E-Commerce Frontend Project Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step implementation plan for building the e-commerce frontend application as defined in the specification (spec.md). The plan is broken down into small, iterative chunks that build upon each other, with specific prompts for a code-generation LLM to implement each step.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

#### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure

```
Create the basic folder structure for our e-commerce application. Set up the essential directories for our Next.js project including the components directory, data directory, and public assets folders as specified in our project specification. Don't create any actual component files yet, just the folder structure and empty placeholder files where needed.
```

#### Step 2: Create JSON Data Files

```
Create the JSON data files for our e-commerce application. We need two files:

1. src/data/categories.json - Create this with 9 categories: Computers, Tablets, Cell Phones, Smart Watches, Mobile Accessories, Headphones, Speakers, TV & Video, and Video Games and Consoles. Each category should have an id, name, slug, and icon field.

2. src/data/products.json - Create this with at least 10 sample products spread across the categories. Each product should include all the fields specified in our data structure: id, name, category_id, price, sale_price (optional), stock, thumbnail, images (array), description, full_description, specifications object, rating, and related_products array.

Make sure the data is realistic and follows the structure in our specification.
```

#### Step 3: Create Basic Components - Header

```
Create a basic Header component (src/components/Header.tsx) for our e-commerce application. The header should include:

1. A search bar
2. A cart icon
3. A user account icon/link

Keep it simple for now - just the structure and basic styling using Tailwind CSS. Don't worry about functionality yet. Make it responsive according to our responsive design specification.
```

#### Step 4: Create Basic Components - Footer

```
Create a Footer component (src/components/Footer.tsx) for our e-commerce application. According to our specification, it should include:

1. Support section with address, email, and phone
2. Account section with links for my account, login/register, cart, wishlist, and shop
3. Quick links section with links to policies, FAQ, and contact

Style it using Tailwind CSS and make it responsive according to our responsive design specification.
```

#### Step 5: Create Basic Components - Sidebar

```
Create a Sidebar component (src/components/Sidebar.tsx) for our e-commerce application. It should:

1. Display a list of all product categories from our categories.json file
2. Have navigation links
3. Be styled with Tailwind CSS

Make sure it's responsive and transforms into a hamburger menu on mobile according to our responsive design specification. Don't implement the mobile menu functionality yet, just the desktop sidebar.
```

### Phase 2: Layout and Core Pages

#### Step 6: Create Mobile Menu Component

```
Create a MobileMenu component (src/components/MobileMenu.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component should be used on mobile devices to replace the sidebar. It should:

1. Display as a hamburger menu icon that, when clicked, shows the categories
2. Use the same category data as the Sidebar
3. Be styled using Tailwind CSS
4. Only appear on mobile screens (< 768px)

Also, create a simple useMediaQuery hook (src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts) to detect the screen size for responsive behavior.
```

#### Step 7: Create Root Layout

```
Create the root layout (src/app/layout.tsx) for our e-commerce application. The layout should:

1. Include the Header and Footer components
2. Conditionally render either the Sidebar (for desktop) or MobileMenu (for mobile) based on screen size
3. Provide a consistent layout for all pages
4. Use appropriate metatags for an e-commerce site
5. Import necessary global styles

Style it using Tailwind CSS according to our UI design specifications.
```

#### Step 8: Create Product Card Component

```
Create a ProductCard component (src/components/ProductCard.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will be used to display product information in the product listing on the home page. It should:

1. Display a product thumbnail image
2. Show the product name
3. Display the price (original price)
4. Show stock availability
5. Include a short description
6. Show the product rating
7. Have hover effects as specified in our UI design
8. Link to the product detail page when clicked
9. Be responsive (smaller on mobile)

Style it using Tailwind CSS according to our UI specifications.
```

#### Step 9: Create Home Page

```
Create the home page (src/app/page.tsx) for our e-commerce application. The page should:

1. Display featured products using the ProductCard component in a grid layout
2. Include a "View more" CTA button for each category section
3. Be responsive according to our specifications (different number of items per row based on screen size)
4. Load products from our products.json file

Style it using Tailwind CSS and make sure it matches our UI design specifications.
```

### Phase 3: Product Detail Page Components

#### Step 10: Create Image Carousel Component

```
Create an ImageCarousel component (src/components/ImageCarousel.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will be used on the product detail page to display multiple product images. It should:

2. Display images in a vertical carousel format
3. Allow users to click on thumbnails to view larger images
4. Be responsive according to our specifications
5. Include smooth transitions between images

Style it using Tailwind CSS according to our UI design specifications.
```

#### Step 11: Create Quantity Selector Component

```
Create a QuantitySelector component (src/components/QuantitySelector.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will be used on the product detail page to allow users to select a quantity. It should:

1. Display a current quantity value
2. Have increment and decrement buttons
3. Prevent selecting quantities less than 1
4. Optionally limit maximum quantity based on stock availability
5. Be styled according to our UI design specifications

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
```

#### Step 12: Create AddToCartButton Component

```
Create an AddToCartButton component (src/components/AddToCartButton.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will be used on the product detail page. It should:

1. Display "Add to Cart" text
2. Have appropriate styling (primary button with our brand color)
3. For now, just log a message to the console when clicked (since actual cart functionality is for future enhancements)
4. Include hover and active states as specified in our UI design

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
```

#### Step 13: Create WishlistButton Component

```
Create a WishlistButton component (src/components/WishlistButton.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will be used on the product detail page. It should:

1. Display as a heart icon or "Add to Wishlist" text (or both)
2. Have appropriate styling (secondary button style)
3. For now, just log a message to the console when clicked
4. Include hover and active states as specified in our UI design

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
```

#### Step 14: Create Accordion Component

2. Toggle between collapsed and expanded states when clicked
3. Display an indicator (like a plus/minus or arrow) to show current state
4. Include smooth animations for expanding/collapsing
5. Be styled according to our UI design specifications

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
```

### Phase 4: Product Detail Page

#### Step 15: Create RelatedItems Component

```
Create a RelatedItems component (src/components/RelatedItems.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will display related products on the product detail page. It should:

1. Accept an array of related product IDs as props
2. Fetch and display those products from our products.json data
3. Use the ProductCard component to display each related product
4. Display as a grid on desktop and a horizontal scrollable carousel on mobile
5. Be styled according to our UI design specifications

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
```

#### Step 16: Create ProductDetail Component

```
Create a ProductDetail component (src/components/ProductDetail.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This component will be the main content of the product detail page. It should:

1. Accept a product object as props
2. Display all product information: name, price, stock availability, description, specifications
3. Include the ImageCarousel component for product images
4. Include the QuantitySelector component
5. Include the AddToCartButton and WishlistButton components
6. Display specifications using the Accordion component on mobile
7. Be responsive according to our specifications

Style it using Tailwind CSS according to our UI design specifications.
```

#### Step 17: Create Product Detail Page

```
Create the product detail page (src/app/product/[id]/page.tsx) for our e-commerce application. This page should:

1. Get the product ID from the URL parameter
2. Fetch the corresponding product data from our products.json file
3. Use the ProductDetail component to display the product information
4. Include the RelatedItems component at the bottom to show related products
5. Be responsive according to our specifications
6. Handle the case when a product is not found (display an appropriate message)

Style it using Tailwind CSS according to our UI design specifications.
```

### Phase 5: Search and Navigation

#### Step 18: Implement Category Navigation

```
Implement category navigation functionality in our e-commerce application:

1. Update the Sidebar and MobileMenu components to make category links functional
2. When a category is clicked, filter the home page to show only products from that category
3. Add a visual indicator for the currently selected category
4. Ensure the navigation works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile

You can implement this by updating the home page to accept a category filter parameter.
```

#### Step 19: Implement Search Functionality

```
Implement basic search functionality in our e-commerce application:

1. Update the search bar in the Header component to be functional
2. When a search is submitted, filter products that match the search term in name or description
3. Display search results on the home page
4. Show a message when no results are found
5. Ensure the search works on both desktop and mobile

You can implement this by updating the home page to accept a search parameter.
```

### Phase 6: Final Touches and Testing

#### Step 20: Add Loading States and Error Handling

```
Add loading states and error handling to our e-commerce application:

1. Create loading indicators for when products are being fetched
2. Add appropriate error messages for when data cannot be loaded
3. Handle edge cases like empty categories, invalid product IDs, etc.
4. Make sure all components gracefully handle missing or incomplete data

Update the necessary components to include these improvements.
```

#### Step 21: Responsive Design Polishing

```
Polish the responsive design of our e-commerce application:

1. Ensure all components look good and function properly at all screen sizes
2. Fix any layout issues or overflow problems
3. Test navigation and user flows on different screen sizes
4. Make sure text is readable and buttons are easy to tap on mobile
5. Verify that the transitions between layouts are smooth

Make any necessary adjustments to achieve a polished responsive design.
```

#### Step 22: Accessibility Improvements

```
Improve the accessibility of our e-commerce application:

1. Add proper ARIA attributes to interactive elements
2. Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and backgrounds
3. Make sure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable
4. Add descriptive alt text to all images
5. Ensure form elements (like the search bar and quantity selector) are properly labeled

Update components as needed to meet these accessibility requirements.
