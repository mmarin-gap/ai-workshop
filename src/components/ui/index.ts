// This file can be used to export commonly used UI components for easier imports.
// For example:
// export * from './Button';
// export * from './Input';
// export * from './Card';

export { Button, buttonVariants } from './Button'; // Added export for Button component
export { Input } from './Input'; // Added export for Input component

// For now, it's a placeholder. You can add exports as you create more UI components.

// If you are using Shadcn UI or a similar library, this might be auto-generated
// or you might manually export components from their respective files.

// Example (if you had a Button component in src/components/ui/Button.tsx):
// export { default as Button } from './Button';

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module.
